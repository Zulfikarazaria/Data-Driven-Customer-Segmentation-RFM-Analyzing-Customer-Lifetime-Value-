# Business Problem & Objective
Currently, online retail players are fiercely competing to win and

success to invest primarily in those customers who are lucrative 
for the company in the long run. It is important to understand 
these customers intimately, to engage them with the right 
channels, and to tailor offers to their context and needs. This can 
only be achieved by drawing on customer-related metrics of 
which customer lifetime value (CLV) is first among equals and by 
interlinking them intelligently as the foundation for effective and 
efficient marketing.<br>
